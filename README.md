# A small React project initaitalising and storing user data via GraphQL

This is a react-based project allowing a user to create a profile, login and logout. It can accomodate multiple users.

I have built it in to be used to add multiple users to other apps i build when nessecary, it is not designed to be used as a stand alone app.

# Some key technologies used:
React 15 for front end components (generally building with class based components)
GraphQL schemas to organise the data structures
Apollo - React library to integrate GraphQL into React
Passport.js to handle the user authentication.
Express to handle server-side logic
MongoDB for database storage & retrieval.

# Setup

- Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the root of the project to install dependencies
- 
- Access the application at `localhost:4000` in your browser
- 
# authorisation-in-graphql
