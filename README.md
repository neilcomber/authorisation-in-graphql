# Small app to be able to sign up users, and login them in and out.

This app allows the user to create a profile, and then login and logout. It is to be used as a wrapper for other apps that need multiple user profiles.


### Setup
- There is only a dev mode, as it is not nessecary to use as a stand alone program, it would only be used in conjunction with other tools.
- Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the root of the project to install dependencies
- Access the application at `localhost:4000` in your browser
