# A small React project initaitalising and storing user data via GraphQL

This is a react project to have multiple seperate users to login & log out.

I have built it in to be used to add multiple users to other apps i build when nessecary.

It is based in React 15 with the data stored on a MongoDB server, with the data structure organised with GraphQL and user authentication handled by passport.js





### Setup

- Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the root of the project to install dependencies
- Access the application at `localhost:4000` in your browser
- 
# authorisation-in-graphql
